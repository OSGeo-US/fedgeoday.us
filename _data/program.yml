  - title: The Opportunity Project
    categories:
      - Workshop
    description: >
      The idea is for the workshop to be a lesson on quick and easy user research. There is a method called ""paper prototyping"" that is great for quickly understanding the flow and user experience of a product or service.
      Throughout the session, participants will grab pen and paper and I'll walk them through some techniques. I can show attendees how to use paper prototyping in a virtual interview environment as well. Here are the goals of the workshop:
      · Learn about Human-Centered Design, and why it's important to test your products before implementation
      · Understand the value of paper prototyping and quick iteration
      o Ex. Low-fidelity prototypes can help participants focus on the bigger picture and flow, rather than the nitty-gritty details
