  - title: Modern Geospatial Cloud Architecture Survey
    categories:
      - Workshop
    description: >
      This session brings together experts from their respective fields to discuss geospatial data processing and dissemination can take full advantage of modern cloud architectures and philosophies. Each speaker will discuss how to approach data, services, and UI's. They will list assumptions and constraints that make their architectural implementations possible. They will share the pros and cons of their proposed geospatial architecture.
      <br/><br/>
      This session will run for 4 hours, 8:00-12:00 AM Eastern. Experts will present, and then we will have an open dialogue. Presentations will be structured around the areas of data, services, and UI's.

  - title: The Opportunity Project
    categories:
      - Workshop
    description: >
      The idea is for the workshop to be a lesson on quick and easy user research. There is a method called ""paper prototyping"" that is great for quickly understanding the flow and user experience of a product or service.
      Throughout the session, participants will grab pen and paper and I'll walk them through some techniques. I can show attendees how to use paper prototyping in a virtual interview environment as well. Here are the goals of the workshop:
      Â· Learn about Human-Centered Design, and why it's important to test your products before implementation
      Â· Understand the value of paper prototyping and quick iteration
      o Ex. Low-fidelity prototypes can help participants focus on the bigger picture and flow, rather than the nitty-gritty details

  - title: Build Your Own Satellite Imagery Web App
    categories:
      - Workshop
    description: >
      Building your own geospatial web application has never been easier.  This workshop is meant for those new to web development, scientists, technical managers, and anyone interested in sharing, visualizing, and analyzing geospatial imagery data on the web.  In this workshop, you will learn how to host an application for free on Github pages, create a simple Leaflet map, display imagery on the web map, and add an analysis component.  You will be able to bring your own data or choose from a pre-selected list of high quality imagery datasets.

  - title: OGC API
    categories:
      - Workshop
    description: >
      The OGC API suite of standards defines modular API building blocks that spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way. OGC APIs make use of the OpenAPI Specification for describing APIs.  Data resources such as features, coverages, maps, styles, metadata records and processes that operate on geospatial data can all be published through OGC APIs. The workshop will provide an overview of OGC APIs and an opportunity for participants to explore a selection of OGC API implements.

    categories:
      - Workshop
    description: >
      Hereâ€™s an opportunity to get started with OpenStreetMap especially for employees and contractors of Federal agencies. TeachOSM will facilitate a workshop introducing the OpenStreetMap project. The workshop will feature:
      <br/><br/>
      * A concise overview of the OpenStreetMap project,
      * An introduction to basic editing techniques, and
      * An overview of the Federal OpenStreetMap pilot program.
      <br/><br/>
      At the end of the workshop you should have a good understanding of:
      <br/><br/>
      * The role of OSM in the geospatial ecosystem,
      * The OpenStreetMap workflow, and
      * Issues related to government use of OpenStreetMap
      <br/><br/>
      Note: A mouse is highly recommended for this workshop.
